    taste a bit more acidic, a quality that is not problematic when making a refreshing cold brew. Mahdi is
    now questioning wheter he should stir his coffee for 24 hours (1) or leave it alone for 24 hours in an
    refrigerated environment (2)""")

    in a microwave would obviously prevent it from adapting many of its succulent flavors. Moreover, it would probably
    even drain your entire electricity bill. But before getting into the process of cooking, creating beef wellington
    requires a lot of preparation prior to doing so. However, Mahdi is curious to find out if he should create the puff
    pastry first (1) or season and cook the filet (2).""")

    his own home-made coffee beans, which he later grinded. He contracted Malaria and realized the immense dangerous in such an act.
